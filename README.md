You want to recommend a movie to a friend based on the rating and popularity. To accomplish this do the following:

- Create a variable for the movie (choose any movie you like).
- Create a variable of type int to hold the rating of the movie out of 5. Give this movie rate = 3
- Create a popularity score of type float, let it be 72.65
- Using an if statement:
    - Check if the movie rating is 4 or greater and the popularity is greater than 80, print "Highly recommended".
    - Else if the movie rating is 3 or greater and the popularity is greater than 70, print "I recommended it, It is good".
    - Else if the movie rating is 2 or less and the popularity is greater than 60, print "You should check it out!".
    - Else the movie rating is 2 or less and the popularity is less than 50, print "Don't watch it, It is a waste of time".
